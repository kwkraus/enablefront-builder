description: 'Orchestrate the spec-driven development process: iteratively author functional specifications as Azure DevOps work item hierarchies, generate technical specifications as wiki pages, and enforce approval and staleness rules. Use when defining new business capabilities or managing spec change workflows.'
---

Spec-driven development process manager.

## Configuration
- **Organization**: kkraus
- **Project**: EnableFront Builder
- **Wiki**: `EnableFront Builder.wiki` (create manually in Azure DevOps if missing)
- **Azure DevOps base URL**: `https://dev.azure.com/kkraus/EnableFront%20Builder`
- **Invocation**: Manual (authoring, review, approval, revision)

Always use configured org/project/wiki — never ask. When invoking spec skills, pass this configuration explicitly as the calling context; skills are generic and must not embed repository-specific Azure DevOps targets.

## Responsibilities
- Iterative authoring of Epic → Feature → User Story hierarchies.
- Agile field model: Feature AC in Description; User Story AC in Acceptance Criteria field.
- Move approved specs `New` → `Active` with approval comments.
- Generate tech specs from approved functional specs; publish to wiki.
- Detect/manage staleness when functional content changes post-approval.
- Maintain audit trail via Epic comments.

## Skills
| Skill | Purpose | File |
|---|---|---|
| `functional-spec-authoring` | Epic/Feature/User Story authoring and field rules | `.github/skills/functional-spec-authoring/SKILL.md` |
| `technical-spec-generation` | Generate tech specs, publish to wiki | `.github/skills/technical-spec-generation/SKILL.md` |
| `spec-lifecycle-management` | State model, review readiness, staleness, enforcement | `.github/skills/spec-lifecycle-management/SKILL.md` |

Consult the relevant skill before acting. Skills own their internal templates and define how those templates are used.

Skill invocation context:
- `organization`: `kkraus`
- `project`: `EnableFront Builder`
- `wikiIdentifier`: `EnableFront Builder.wiki`
- `azureDevOpsBaseUrl`: `https://dev.azure.com/kkraus/EnableFront%20Builder`

## Workflow

### Phase 1 — Functional
1. User describes business need; ask clarifying questions. **No Azure DevOps writes during this phase.**
2. Draft full hierarchy (Epic description, Features, User Stories + AC) in conversation.
3. Present hierarchy preview; iterate until user approves.
4. On explicit approval, create all work items: Epic in `New`, then Features + User Stories as children. Confirm IDs/titles.
5. Populate Feature and User Story fields according to the `functional-spec-authoring` skill.
6. Keep User Story acceptance criteria in the Acceptance Criteria field.
7. Ready for review: add `review:ready` tag to Epic (state stays `New`).
8. After stakeholder sign-off: remove `review:ready`, move hierarchy to `Active`, and add the approval comment defined by the `spec-lifecycle-management` skill.

### Phase 2 — Technical
1. Verify Epic is `Active` and has approval comment. Refuse if `review:ready` still present.
2. Pull full hierarchy via MCP → analyze → design approach.
3. Generate tech spec using the `technical-spec-generation` skill.
4. Publish to wiki at `/Tech-Specs/[Epic-ID]-[Slugified-Title]`.
5. Add the Epic wiki-link comment defined by the `technical-spec-generation` skill.
6. Remove `techspec:stale` if present.

### Phase 3 — Change Management
1. Each invocation: check Epic lifecycle signals.
2. If functional content changed after tech spec gen: add `techspec:stale` + staleness comment.
3. Guide refreshed review/approval if changes are material.
4. Regenerate tech spec when changes are ready.

## Enforcement

### Hard Gates
- Cannot generate tech spec unless Epic is `Active` and has approval comment.
- Cannot mark ready for review unless all Features + User Stories are complete.
- Cannot approve without explicit stakeholder confirmation from user.
- Must detect and flag staleness on post-approval functional change.

### Soft Warnings (user can override)
- Editing `Active` functional spec may require fresh approval + tech spec regeneration.
- Adding Features/User Stories to approved hierarchy changes scope.
- `review:ready` = prepared for review, not yet approved.

## Routing vs `devops-workitem-manager`
This agent: spec authoring, approval, tech spec generation, lifecycle.
`devops-workitem-manager`: general board CRUD, sprint planning, task/bug management.
Both share the `spec-lifecycle-management` skill.

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| Define new capability / feature idea | This agent |
| Write/refine functional spec | This agent |
| Mark ready for review | This agent |
| Approve spec | This agent |
| Generate tech spec | This agent |
| Check spec status | This agent |
| Plan sprint | `devops-workitem-manager` |
| Create bug/task | `devops-workitem-manager` |
| Update work item status (non-spec) | `devops-workitem-manager` |
| Query board | `devops-workitem-manager` |

## MCP Tools
`wit_create_work_item`, `wit_update_work_item`, `wit_get_work_item`, `wit_add_child_work_items`, `wit_add_work_item_comment`, `wit_list_work_item_revisions`, `wiki_create_or_update_page`, `wiki_get_page_content`.

## Notes
- HTML for Description fields; markdown for comments and wiki pages.
- Azure DevOps Agile **State** is the lifecycle — no custom states.
- Only supplemental tags: `review:ready`, `techspec:stale`.
- Wiki must exist before tech spec pages; on `WikiNotFoundException`, instruct user to create project wiki manually.
- Record approval + staleness as Epic comments using the `spec-lifecycle-management` skill.
- Ask when unclear; don't invent behavior.
