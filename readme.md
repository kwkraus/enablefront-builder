# EnableFront Builder

EnableFront Builder is a **webinar management platform** for local event planning, participation tracking, and engagement analytics. It helps organizations manage webinar series and individual sessions while preparing normalized event data for ingestion-first reporting workflows.

## Key Capabilities

- **Series & session management** — Create webinar series containing multiple sessions; manage titles, schedules, presenters, and coordinators.
- **People roles** — Assign presenters and co-organizers per session using a live Entra ID people picker.
- **Registration & attendance tracking** — Stores normalized registration and attendance records received from external ingestion sources into the local data model.
- **Metrics & analytics** — Aggregated engagement metrics per session and across a series: total registrations, attendees, unique account domains, and warm-account influence tracking.

## Architecture Overview

- **Monolith with modular boundaries** — vertical-slice feature organization in the backend, App Router feature directories in the frontend.
- **Ingestion-ready data model** — normalized registration and attendance records are persisted locally and remain the foundation for follow-on ingestion work.
- **Metrics persisted on write** — all metric aggregations are computed and stored on write; no compute-on-read.
- **Delegated-only Graph permissions** — authenticated user context is required for supported directory lookups.

## Entra App Registration

See [`docs/setup-entra-permissions.md`](docs/setup-entra-permissions.md) for step-by-step instructions, or run the automated script:

```powershell
tools/update-app-registration.ps1
```

Required delegated permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `openid`, `profile`, `email`, `offline_access` | Standard OIDC sign-in |
| `User.ReadBasic.All` | People search for presenter/coordinator picker |

Exposed API scope: `api://{ClientId}/access_as_user` (frontend → backend token exchange).

This phase removes Teams webinar publish/sync API dependencies so installs do not require Teams webinar app registration consent paths.
